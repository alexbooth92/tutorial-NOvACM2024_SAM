# tutorial-NOvACM2024_SAM
A tutorial on SAM for NOvA for the July 2024 Collaboration Meeting at University of Minnesota. Please see docdb- for supporting slides.

To work with SAM on the NOvA GPVMs simply setup a `novasoft` environment as you normally would. For example:

```
source /cvmfs/nova.opensciencegrid.org/novasoft/slf7/novasoft/setup/setup_nova.sh
spack load nova-grid-utils
sl7-nova -r development
```
